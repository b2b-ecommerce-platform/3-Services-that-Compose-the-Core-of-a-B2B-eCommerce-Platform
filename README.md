# 3 Services that Compose the Core of a B2B eCommerce Platform
## 1. User authentication and permissions control.

This is a no-brainer. Any ecommerce portal must know its users, and any service that needs to verify the user's identity should be included in this category. This service also forms the basis for personalization, UX enhancements, complex pricing models, and so on with more sophisticated [B2B eCommerce Platform](https://virtocommerce.com/b2b-ecommerce-platform).

## 2. Communication service for other ecommerce services and software

You may link services to some small ecommerce sites directly. It might appear to be a good plan at first glance as it's cheap and quick. You just need to create a basic page with order statuses and reorder button; you don't need any sophisticated platform for it. However, this road has several disadvantages that tend to mount over time.

The number of services utilized in an ecommerce solution grows as the digital transformation progresses, along with the number of communication channels between them. For example: we have 10 services that need to connect to one another, each with its own unique [API](https://virtocommerce.com/api-ecommerce). We'll have to teach each of them distinct "languages" before the system can be connected and start functioning. If we decide to change one of them, we'll need to teach the new service these new "languages " and re-educate the rest. Given that these services may come from various locations in the system, ecommerce, business ecosystem, payment and logistics tools, as well as the customer's side, such re-education is quite hard and takes time.

Although it's sometimes okay to start with direct connections, such as assessing a user adoption success, this approach must be abandoned and a flexible & adaptable ecommerce platform should be chosen instead.

## 3. Data accumulation and real-time delivery ecommerce service

A [B2B ecommerce portal](https://virtocommerce.com/solutions/b2b-portal) must deliver all data to a user in real time. The business environment, on the other hand, may not be able to do so. Because an ERP integration isn't typically designed for simultaneous real-time interaction with many users, some form of data concentrator is required.

This service is like a "one-stop shop" for the user: it gathers data in real time, synchronizes with an [ERP](https://virtocommerce.com/integrations/ecommerce-erp-integrations) on a regular basis, and presents it in real time. When required, it does light checks with back-office software.

Because data may come from a variety of sources and be utilized by many types of users, there may be numerous data accumulation and transfer solutions, each performing a little part. This method allows for faster real-time data delivery without slowing down the back-office. These ecommerce services, technically speaking, utilize asynchronous communications with the back-office to manage the dataflow.

### A headless core of B2B platform

While the aforementioned services are certainly essential to a [B2B eCommerce Platform](https://virtocommerce.com/b2b-ecommerce-platform), they still adhere to those standards in an API-based open architecture. This means that they are not a rigid structure with everything else built around it. They can be replaced, expanded, multiplied, or even eliminated altogether if necessary like any other service within a [headless](https://virtocommerce.com/headless-ecommerce) ecommerce platform.

As the platform expands, users' demands become more apparent, new technologies appear or a viable option emerges, and ecommerce services will adapt as necessary. Because that is the nature of open architecture and its strongest point. The capacity to alter is what distinguishes the headless approach as the finest B2B company digital transformation strategy.
